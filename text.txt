The Longest Ride, my seventeenth novel, could not have been written without the support of many wonderful people. At the top of my list, as always, is my wife Cathy, who has remained after all these years the best friend I've ever had. My life has been enriched by her presence on a daily basis, and part of me knows that every female character I've ever created is in no small way inspired by her. It's been a joy to share with her the longest ride, this thing we call life. I must also thank Theresa Park – my literary agent, manager, and now producing partner – yet another extraordinary blessing in my life. It's hard for me to believe that we've been working together for nineteen years now. Though I've told you many times before, it's time for me to put it in writing: I've always considered myself to be the fortunate one. Jamie Raab, my editor, is priceless when it comes to making my novels as good as they can possibly be. She has been my editor since the very beginning, and working with her has made me one of the luckiest authors around. She deserves my thanks not only for all she does, but also because I consider her a cherished friend. Howie Sanders and Keya Khayatian – my film agents at UTA – are quite simply the best in the business. More than that, they're creative geniuses in all aspects of business. Add in kindness, honesty, and enthusiasm, and the more time I spend with them, the more thrilled I am to consider them friends. Scott Schwimer, my entertainment attorney, is yet another member of my team who has been with me since the very beginning, a man who has gifted my life with his wisdom and advice.
